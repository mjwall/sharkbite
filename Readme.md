[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phrocker/sharkbite.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phrocker/sharkbite)

**S**harkbite is a native client for key/value stores. With 
initial support for [Apache Accumulo][accumulo], the design can and has been used to support other key/value
stores. Development began in 2014 and has  slowly evolved. there is no structural specificity to Accumulo
despite being the baseimplementation. Despite this the examples below will look very much like Accumulo due to aliasing. This is intentional.

Currently the code is a merger of C && C++ code. V0.1 will represent a shift more toward 
creating a C API and creating exernalized factories for the thrift code.

Capabilities That will be supported in V0.1 : 

 * Work with Accumulo 1.6.x and 1.7.x
 * **Read/Write** : Reading and writing data to Accumulo is currently supported.
 * **Table Operations** : Most table operations are currently supported. This includes the fate operations that the normal Accumulo client performs.
 * **Security Operations** : Security operations aren't all implemented, but you should be able to add users, change authorizations, passwords, and remove users.

## Requirements

	GNU 4+
	cmake
	make
	thrift
	zookeeper
	libhdfs3

## Building
```
	run install scripts located in root directory

	mkdir build && cd build && cmake .. && cmake --build . ; make test

	This will build the package and library, which you can use. It will also build
	examples in the examples directory
```

## Example
```C++

    //This code shows an example of reading data from an Accumulo instance.

    //TODO unsure about assignments below
    string instance = argv[1]
    string zookeepers = argv[2]
    string username = argv[3]
    string password = argv[4]

    ZookeeperInstance *instance = new ZookeeperInstance(instance, zookeepers, 1000);

    AuthInfo creds(username, password, instance->getInstanceId());

    interconnect::MasterConnect *master = new MasterConnect(&creds, instance);

    std::unique_ptr<interconnect::AccumuloTableOperations> ops = master->tableOps(
            table);
    // create the scanner with ten threads.
    std::unique_ptr<scanners::BatchScanner> scanner = ops->createScanner (&auths, 10);
    // range from a to d
    Key *startkey = new Key();
    startkey->setRow("a", 1);
    Key *stopKey = new Key();
    stopKey->setRow("d", 1);
    Range *range = new Range(startkey, true, stopKey, true); 
    // build your range.
    scanner->addRange(range);

    scanners::Iterator<cclient::data::KeyValue> *results =
	                scanner->getResultSet ();

    for (auto iter = results->begin(); iter != results->end(); iter++) {
        KeyValue *kv = *iter;
        if (kv != NULL && kv->getKey() != NULL)
            cout << "got -- " << (*iter)->getKey() << endl;
        else
            cout << "Key is null" << endl;
    }
```
